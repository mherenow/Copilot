    "content": "**Merge Sort Algorithm**\n==========================\n\n### Overview\n\nMerge sort is a popular sorting algorithm that uses a divide-and-conquer approach to sort an array of elements. It works by dividing the array into smaller subarrays, sorting each subarray, and then merging the sorted subarrays back together.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef merge_sort(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    Sorts an array using the merge sort algorithm.\n\n    Args:\n        arr (list): The array to sort.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: The sorted array.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Base case: If the array has 1 or fewer elements, it is already sorted\n    if len(arr) <= 1:\n        return arr\n\n    # Divide the array into two halves\n    mid = len(arr) // 2\n    left_half = arr[:mid]\n    right_half = arr[mid:]\n\n    # Recursively sort the two halves\n    left_half = merge_sort(left_half)\n    right_half = merge_sort(right_half)\n\n    # Merge the two sorted halves\n    return merge(left_half, right_half)\n\n\ndef merge(left, right):\n    \"\"\"\n    Merges two sorted arrays into a single sorted array.\n\n    Args:\n        left (list): The first sorted array.\n        right (list): The second sorted array.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: The merged sorted array.\n    \"\"\"\n    merged = []\n    left_index = 0\n    right_index = 0\n\n    # Merge smaller elements first\n    while left_index < len(left) and right_index < len(right):\n        if left[left_index] <= right[right_index]:\n            merged.append(left[left_index])\n            left_index += 1\n        else:\n            merged.append(right[right_index])\n            right_index += 1\n\n    # Append any remaining elements\n    merged.extend(left[left_index:])\n    merged.extend(right[right_index:])\n\n    return merged\n\n\n# Example usage:\narr = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]\nprint(\"Original array:\", arr)\nprint(\"Sorted array:\", merge_sort(arr))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe merge sort algorithm works as follows:\n\n1.  **Divide**: Divide the array into two halves, `left_half` and `right_half`.\n2.  **Conquer**: Recursively sort `left_half` and `right_half` using the same merge sort algorithm.\n3.  **Merge**: Merge the two sorted halves into a single sorted array.\n\nThe `merge` function takes two sorted arrays, `left` and `right`, and merges them into a single sorted array. It does this by comparing elements from `left` and `right` and appending the smaller element to the `merged` array.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of the merge sort algorithm is **O(n log n)**, where n is the number of elements in the array. This is because the algorithm divides the array in half at each level of recursion, resulting in a logarithmic number of levels. At each level, the algorithm merges the sorted subarrays, resulting in a linear number of operations.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\nThe space complexity of the merge sort algorithm is **O(n)**, where n is the number of elements in the array. This is because the algorithm creates temporary arrays to store the sorted subarrays during the merge process.\n\n### Advantages\n\n*   **Stable**: Merge sort is a stable sorting algorithm, meaning that it preserves the order of equal elements.\n*   **Efficient**: Merge sort has a time complexity of O(n log n), making it efficient for large datasets.\n*   **Scalable**: Merge sort can be easily parallelized, making it suitable for large-scale sorting tasks.\n\n### Disadvantages\n\n*   **Extra memory**: Merge sort requires extra memory to store the temporary arrays during the merge process.\n*   **Complex implementation**: Merge sort has a more complex implementation compared to other sorting algorithms like bubble sort or insertion sort."
